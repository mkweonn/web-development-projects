		<h2>Scope</h2>
		<p>How many pages are you planning to have? What are the pages?</p>
		<p>I am planning on having 3 main pages. The first page will be the discover section where users can search new cafes based on the name, cafe type (study, aesthetic, late night, taste, etc), and location of the LA area (Koreatown, DTLA, etc). It will display the cafe as well as some info about it. Another page will be allow them to track the cafes they have been to by adding and deleting items. Lastly, there will be a page where they can input information about a new cafe they went to. It will have details about the cafe (their review) and be added to their list.</p>

		<h2>Database</h2>
		<p>The database will store information about cafes in LA such as their names, locations, cafe type, and its features. I plan to have a relationship between users and their cafes they went to as well as cafe and the type or location it is in. The source will be from user-generated/inputted data and with data that is pre-stored by me. I might integrate Yelp Fusion API for data.
